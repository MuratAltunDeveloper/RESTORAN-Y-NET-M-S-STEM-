In this project, I aim to simulate a restaurant management system. In the restaurant, customers, waiters, waitresses, cooks and cashiers are modeled as separate threads that perform different tasks. Each thread performs its job for a certain period of time and resource management is provided by using thread synchronization. The resources of the restaurant include items such as tables, waiters, waitresses, cooks and cashiers, and their interaction is simulated. During the simulation, timings and processes are set with specific durations, customer flow and resource optimization are calculated. Furthermore, a user-friendly GUI is used to manage the processes and different interfaces are designed for each type of employee.
